# The 8-Block Prompt Template

Every vidux lane — Claude Code or Codex — has a `prompt.md` on disk that drives each cycle. The prompt follows an 8-block structure so any agent picking up the lane knows exactly what to read, when to gate, how to act, and what it owns.

For the runtime mechanics of how the prompt is injected each fire, see [claude-lifecycle.md](../fleet/claude-lifecycle.md) and [codex-lifecycle.md](../fleet/codex-lifecycle.md).

## The 8 Blocks

```
1. Mission       — why this lane exists, one paragraph
2. Skills        — skill tokens this lane activates
3. Read          — files to read every cycle, in order
4. Gate          — pre-flight checks that can abort the cycle
5. Assess        — priority rules for picking the next action
6. Act           — how to actually do the work
7. Authority     — paths owned vs paths forbidden
8. Checkpoint    — what to write to memory.md at the end
```

Every block is required. A lane missing any of them is underspecified and will produce drift.

## Block 1: Mission

One paragraph. What this lane exists to accomplish, and what "done" looks like.

```markdown
## 1. Mission

Ship and maintain the project surface this lane owns. Every cycle either moves a
[pending] PLAN.md task forward, fixes a CI failure, or merges an
eligible PR. When the queue is empty, scout INBOX.md for promotions
or rotate a filler audit. The lane retires when the owning PLAN.md
hits its named ship milestone.
```

**Rules:**
- Present-tense and concrete. Not "help with" — state the goal.
- Name the PLAN.md path the lane drives.
- Name the retirement condition. A lane without an exit is a zombie.

## Block 2: Skills

A list of skill tokens (starting with `/vidux`) that the lane should invoke before acting. Skills load the domain knowledge and discipline each cycle.

```markdown
## 2. Skills

Activate these skills every cycle, in order:
- `/vidux` — discipline + automation (cycle, FSM, checkpoint format, Part 2 lane mechanics)
```

**Rules:**
- Put `/vidux` first so the cycle and FSM load before anything else.
- Add repo-specific brand or domain skills only when the lane genuinely needs them.
- Avoid loading skills the lane never uses — every token costs context.

## Block 3: Read

Explicit file-read order. Every cycle reads the same files in the same order, so every agent starts with the same worldview.

```markdown
## 3. Read

Read in this order every cycle:
1. `memory.md` — last 3 entries, so I know what the previous cycle did
2. `{project-root}/PLAN.md` — queue state, Decision Log
3. `{project-root}/INBOX.md` — scanner findings
4. `git fetch && git status --short && git log --oneline -10` — repo state
5. `gh pr list --json number,title,mergeable,statusCheckRollup` — open PRs
6. (cross-lane) `{lane-dir}/session-gc/memory.md` — last 1 entry when session-gc exists
```

**Rules:**
- Start with own `memory.md` — self-awareness before world-awareness.
- End with any cross-lane reads that catch concurrent-cycle conflicts.
- Name shell commands literally — agents copy-paste them.

## Block 4: Gate

Pre-flight checks that can **abort the cycle** before any action. Gates stop bad cycles cheaply.

```markdown
## 4. Gate

Abort this cycle (append `[QC] <reason>` to memory.md and exit) if:

- Dirty tree NOT mine (uncommitted work from another session or lane)
  → `[QC] concurrent-cycle` and exit
- Same PLAN.md task in `[in_progress]` for 3+ consecutive cycles
  → Set task to `[blocked]` with a Decision Log entry, then exit
- Main CI is RED on latest commit
  → Fix-first mode: triage the failing job, ignore other work
- Post-push defer: last cycle pushed a PR
  → This cycle may only review CI — do not attempt merge until
    1h since last fix-push AND all checks green
```

**Rules:**
- Gates are binary: trigger → exit. Don't "maybe work around it."
- A concurrent-cycle exit is not a failure — it's the correct move.
- Keep the list short. Too many gates and cycles never fire.

## Block 5: Assess

The priority rule for picking **the one thing this cycle will do**. Unified so two agents running the same lane pick the same task.

```markdown
## 5. Assess

Priority order (first match wins):

1. Main CI red → fix the failure
2. Open PR with failing checks → fix-push
3. Open PR eligible for merge (CI green, push-age ≥1h, no P0/P1 reviews) → merge
4. PLAN.md has `[in_progress]` task → resume it (prior session died mid-task)
5. PLAN.md has `[pending]` task with evidence → promote to `[in_progress]`, execute
6. PLAN.md empty + INBOX.md has promotable finding → promote it to a task
7. All of the above empty → rotate one filler audit (bundle-size, sitemap, a11y),
   then exit [IDLE]
```

**Rules:**
- Exactly ONE action per cycle. Multi-tasking breaks checkpointing.
- `[in_progress]` always resumes first — never leave mid-task work orphaned.
- `[IDLE]` is a valid outcome. Not all cycles ship.

## Block 6: Act

How to actually do the work. This block holds the heavy rules — worktree discipline, verification commands, merge procedure, and any delegation contracts.

```markdown
## 6. Act

### Code changes (worktree discipline)
- Create a fresh worktree from origin/main for every code change
- `git worktree add -b {branch} ../{project}-worktrees/{branch} origin/main`
- Never edit files on the main worktree directly

### Verification (mandatory before commit)
- `npm run lint` — must pass
- `npm run build` — must complete
- UI change? Take a screenshot with Playwright or craft-svg

### Commit + push
- `git add {specific files}` — never `-A`
- Commit message: `{verb}({scope}): {what}`
- After commit, `git branch --show-current` must match intended branch
- Build the PR body with `python3 scripts/vidux-pr-body.py --lane "{lane}" --task "{task-id}" --resume "{resume point}" --change "{summary}" [--linear EVE-123] > /tmp/vidux-pr-body.md`
- Open a ready PR with `gh pr create --base main --head "{branch}" --title "{title}" --body-file /tmp/vidux-pr-body.md`

### Merge (only when gate allows)
- `gh pr merge {n} --squash --auto` — only if CI green, push-age ≥1h,
  zero unresolved P0/P1 reviews

### Delegation (optional — Mode A / Mode B)
- If reading > 3 KB of source, use the runtime's native subagent primitive
  for Mode A research compression. See `guides/recipes/subagent-delegation.md`.
- For bug fixes with a clear spec (>10 lines), use Mode B implementation
  delegation in the same runtime, then review the diff before shipping.
```

**Rules:**
- Every verification command is literal — don't paraphrase.
- "Never `git add -A`" prevents the classic "accidentally committed .env" bug.
- Delegation is optional per lane; include the sub-block only if the lane ships code.

## Block 7: Authority

Explicit paths the lane **owns** vs paths it must **never** touch. The authority block is the lane's immune system.

```markdown
## 7. Authority

### Paths this lane owns (may edit freely)
- `{repo-owned-source-paths}`
- `{project-root}/PLAN.md`, `{project-root}/INBOX.md`, `{project-root}/evidence/`
- `{lane-dir}/{lane-id}/memory.md`

### Paths this lane must NEVER touch
- `{human-authored-prose-paths}` body text when the repo treats that prose as immutable
- `.env*` files (secrets)
- `scripts/**` (cross-lane tooling, not coord-owned)
- Other lanes' `memory.md` files — read-only

### Push authorization
- Operational PRs: push branch + open ready-for-review by default; no approval needed.
- Draft PRs: only for true WIP or a missing gate; flip ready as soon as the gate passes.
- PR body must carry `Lane:`, `Plan task:`, `Resume point:`, and `Linear:` when the public Linear id is known.
- Direct-to-main or destructive operations (force-push, branch delete, `git reset --hard`): forbidden for this lane.
```

**Rules:**
- List the "never touch" paths explicitly — a lane that silently edits out-of-scope files is worse than a lane that does nothing.
- Cite the **reason** for forbidden paths (historical prose, secrets, cross-lane). Future agents read the reason to judge edge cases.
- The push-authorization section is mandatory for any code-writing lane. See SKILL.md for the full contract.

## Block 8: Checkpoint

The `memory.md` append format. One line per cycle. Future agents scan the last 3 entries to pick up context.

```markdown
## 8. Checkpoint

After the cycle, append ONE line to
`{lane-dir}/{lane-id}/memory.md`:

### Signal-only format

```
- [YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ {runtime} {lane-role}] [TAG] {what happened}. {optional second sentence on next-cycle plan}.
```

### Valid tags
- `[SHIP]` — pushed a PR
- `[MERGED]` — merged a PR
- `[FIX]` — fixed a CI failure
- `[PROMOTE]` — promoted an INBOX item to a task
- `[DEFER]` — post-push defer / active review wait / human currently driving the surface
- `[IDLE]` — queue empty, no work surfaced
- `[QC]` — aborted cycle (dirty tree, stuck, etc)
- `[AUDIT-N]` — rotated filler audit N
- `[MILESTONE]` — plan phase boundary / big ship / course correction

### No-noise rule
No "everything fine" entries. If there's nothing to report beyond what
the last entry already said, skip the entry entirely.
```

**Rules:**
- One line, not a paragraph. The diff tells the story; memory.md orients.
- Always tag. Untagged entries are unsearchable by future agents.
- Include the session SHA (`{session-sha}`) when the lane hosts cross-session state.

## Full Example

A real (abridged) prompt file showing all 8 blocks:

```markdown
# project-coordinator — lane prompt

## 1. Mission
Ship and maintain the owned project surface. Every cycle moves PLAN.md
forward, fixes CI, merges eligible PRs, or rotates a filler audit.

## 2. Skills
- /vidux

## 3. Read
1. memory.md (last 3)
2. {project-root}/PLAN.md
3. {project-root}/INBOX.md
4. `git fetch && git status --short && git log --oneline -10`
5. `gh pr list`

## 4. Gate
- Dirty tree not mine → [QC] concurrent-cycle, exit
- Same task [in_progress] 3+ cycles → [blocked] + exit
- Main CI red → fix-first mode
- Post-push defer: previous cycle pushed → no merge attempt this cycle

## 5. Assess
Priority: CI red > failing PR fix > eligible PR merge > resume [in_progress]
> first [pending] with evidence > promote INBOX > rotate filler audit > [IDLE]

## 6. Act
- Fresh worktree per code change
- Verify: lint + build + (UI) screenshot
- Commit: `{verb}({scope}): {what}`; never `git add -A`
- PR body: `scripts/vidux-pr-body.py` with Lane / Plan task / Resume point / optional Linear
- Merge: gh pr merge --squash --auto; only if CI green + push-age ≥1h
- Delegate via native Mode A / Mode B subagents when the task is large enough

## 7. Authority
- Owns: {repo-owned-source-paths}, {project-root}/PLAN.md, INBOX.md, evidence/
- Never: {human-authored-prose-paths} body, .env*, other lanes' memory.md
- Push tier: operational PRs only; ready-for-review by default, canonical PR body required, no direct-to-main/destructive ops

## 8. Checkpoint
Append one line to memory.md:
`- [YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ {runtime} {lane-role}] [TAG] {what}. {next-cycle hint}.`
Tags: SHIP / MERGED / FIX / PROMOTE / DEFER / IDLE / QC / AUDIT-N / MILESTONE.
No "everything fine" entries.
```

A prompt.md this tight fits in under ~80 lines and gives any agent everything needed to run one cycle correctly.

## Common Failure Modes

Prompts fail in predictable ways. If you hit one of these, add the missing block.

| Failure | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Agent edits forbidden files | Block 7 missing or vague | Enumerate forbidden paths with reasons |
| Two agents both grab the same task | Block 5 priority non-deterministic | Sharpen priority order; "first match wins" |
| Lane ships 5 redundant polish PRs | Block 6 missing polish-brake rule | Add: "if last 3 ships same surface → force rotate" |
| Memory.md unreadable drift | Block 8 format sloppy or missing | Enforce one-line + tagged format |
| Agent reads wrong PLAN.md | Block 3 doesn't name the absolute path | Use absolute paths, not relative |
| Lane never exits | Block 1 missing retirement condition | Add "retires when X" to Mission |
