# Fleet Operations Reference

Operations manual for running a fleet of vidux automations. Loaded by `/codex` and `/claude` when managing fleets. Core SKILL.md covers doctrine and planning; this doc covers the multi-automation coordination layer.

## Cross-Lane Awareness (Doctrine 13)

> An automation that doesn't know what its siblings are doing is a solo agent pretending to be part of a fleet.

Every automation MUST read sibling state during its READ step. Not optional. Not "when convenient." Structural. Before acting:

1. **Sibling memory scan** -- Read the last note from every sibling automation's memory file (e.g., `~/.codex/automations/*/memory.md` for Codex, `~/.claude-automations/*/memory.md` for Claude). Know what shipped in the last hour and what surfaces are claimed.

2. **Hot-files check** -- Read `.agent-ledger/hot-files.md` in the target repo. If another lane is actively touching files you are about to touch, yield or coordinate. Two lanes editing the same file in the same cycle produces merge conflicts that waste the next cycle to resolve.

3. **Fleet duplicate detection** -- If your planned work overlaps with what a sibling just shipped, skip it. Don't fix what's already fixed. Don't scan what was just scanned. The dedup check is a single pass over sibling memory notes -- it costs seconds and saves entire cycles.

**Where this goes in the harness prompt:** Immediately after the Authority/read-order block and before the Execution block. The agent reads the gate, then reads authority, then reads siblings, then acts.

**Real failure:** Five Beacon radars polled the same empty queue without knowing each other existed. `acme-web` didn't know `acme-backend` just fixed the same surface. Both shipped competing branches. The merge cost more than the original fix.

**How to apply:** Every harness prompt's READ step must include sibling context. The orchestrator should detect fleet-level patterns (6 idle automations = dead fleet, 3 lanes touching same file = collision), not wordsmith individual prompts. Ledger reads and hot-files checks are as mandatory as reading PLAN.md.

---

## Trunk Health (Doctrine 15)

> A dirty or diverged canonical checkout is a fleet-level infrastructure failure, not a per-task blocker. Detect it in 10 seconds, not after 45 minutes of deep work.

Every automation works in a worktree and tries to merge back to the default branch at the end. If the canonical checkout is dirty, diverged, or behind origin, that merge-back fails. The automation then pushes to a branch instead -- real work that nobody absorbs.

Overnight this compounds: 10 automations x 8 hours = 80 cycles producing branches that never land on main. vidux-loop.sh counts these as "unproductive" because no PLAN.md task state changed, which triggers auto-pause, which makes it worse.

### Trunk health check (first 10 seconds of every writer gate)

```bash
git -C <repo> status --short --branch
git -C <repo> rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
git -C <repo> rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD
```

- If diverged >5 commits: escalate immediately ("trunk diverged, needs human reconciliation") instead of doing deep work that will fail to merge back.
- If dirty: escalate ("trunk dirty, unsafe to merge").

### Plan file integrity

A "clean" trunk (no dirty files, no divergence) can still be catastrophically broken if PLAN.md was clobbered by a stale worktree merge. A dirty trunk is visible; a clobbered plan is invisible -- tasks silently vanish, automations park on `auto_pause_recommended` because their tasks no longer exist, and the plan looks "complete" when it is actually destroyed. The trunk health check must verify task count stability, not just git status.

### Branch pushes are productive output

An automation that ships code to a branch, pushes it to origin, and records the branch name in its memory note is shipping. The unproductive streak counter must not penalize this -- the work exists, it just needs absorption.

---

## Branch Absorption

The lead writer absorbs branches. The release-train or equivalent lead writer must check for unmerged sibling branches during its READ step and merge them before popping new tasks. This is not optional. Without it, branches accumulate until a human manually merges them.

### Protocol (run during the lead writer's READ step, before popping new tasks)

**a. Scan for unmerged sibling branches:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git branch -r --list "origin/claude/*" --list "origin/codex/*" | while read b; do
  commits=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..$b)
  [ "$commits" -gt 0 ] && echo "$b ($commits unmerged)"
done
```

**b. If branches have unmerged commits:** merge them to main before starting new work. This keeps trunk current and prevents branch accumulation across overnight fleet cycles.

**c. If merge is unsafe (conflicts):** do not force it. Record the conflicting branch in the automation's memory note and skip it. A human or the owning automation resolves it.

**d. After absorbing:** push main to origin so other automations see the updated trunk:
```bash
git push origin main
```

**e. Why this is non-optional:** 10 automations x 8 hours = 80 cycles. If each pushes to a branch instead of main, that is 80 branches nobody absorbs. `vidux-loop.sh` counts these as unproductive (no PLAN.md state change), which triggers auto-pause, which makes the accumulation worse. The absorber breaks this cycle.

---

## Worktree Handoff Protocol

Cron agents are stateless but worktrees are not. When a session dies mid-task inside a worktree, the next cycle has no way to discover that in-progress work unless it is recorded in the plan. Without this protocol, cron agents duplicate work or create competing worktrees.

### Rules

1. **Register on entry.** When a cron agent creates or enters a worktree, it MUST add an `## Active Worktrees` section to PLAN.md (or append to an existing one) with:
   ```
   - branch: <branch-name> | path: <worktree-path> | task: <Task N description> | status: <in_progress|blocked>
   ```

2. **Read before starting.** Every cron cycle reads `## Active Worktrees` during the READ step (after Decision Log, before git log). If an entry exists for the current task, resume the worktree instead of creating a new one.

3. **Remove on completion.** When worktree work is merged or abandoned, delete the entry from `## Active Worktrees` and add a Decision Log line:
   ```
   - [WORKTREE] [date] Merged/abandoned <branch>. Reason: <why>.
   ```

4. **Stale detection.** If a worktree entry persists across 3 cron cycles with no progress (same status, no new commits on the branch), mark the associated task `[blocked]` with `[Blocker: stale worktree -- no progress in 3 cycles]` and note it in the next Progress entry.

5. **Plan file merge safety.** Any merge that touches PLAN.md must verify that the task count did not decrease unless tasks were explicitly marked `[completed]` and archived. PLAN.md is append-mostly by design -- new tasks are added, completed tasks are archived, but tasks are never silently removed. Before completing a merge that modifies PLAN.md, compare task counts:
   ```bash
   pre=$(git show origin/main:path/to/PLAN.md | grep -c '^\- \[')
   post=$(grep -c '^\- \[' path/to/PLAN.md)
   [ "$post" -lt "$pre" ] && echo "PLAN CLOBBER: task count dropped from $pre to $post"
   ```
   If the count drops, abort the merge and escalate. Worktree branches should minimize PLAN.md edits -- confine changes to their own task status updates.

6. **Branch absorber role.** In a multi-automation fleet, sibling automations push code to `claude/*` or `codex/*` branches but never merge them to main. Without an explicit absorber, branches accumulate overnight until a human manually cleans up. The lead writer (e.g., release-train) owns this role. See "Branch Absorption" section above for the full protocol.

### Worktree merge-back rule (for prompts)

Every automation that uses `execution_environment = "worktree"` MUST merge its commits back to the default branch before exiting. Without this, the runtime creates a fresh worktree each cycle. The agent works, commits, checkpoints, exits. The commits stay in the worktree branch. After 48 hours you have 90+ orphan worktrees with real commits that never reached main.

**The rule (add to block 7 -- Execution in the prompt):**
```
WORKTREE RULE: Before stopping, merge your worktree commits to the default branch.
- If the work is complete and tests pass: merge to main, push, delete the worktree branch.
- If the work is incomplete but safe: merge what you have, note remaining work in memory.
- If the work conflicts or is unsafe to merge: record in Decision Log why not, and leave
  the branch name in your memory note so the next cycle can resume it instead of creating new.
- NEVER exit with unmerged worktree commits without explanation.
- NEVER create a new worktree if a previous one for this lane has unmerged commits.
```

**Detecting orphan worktrees:**
```bash
git worktree list | grep -v "detached HEAD" | grep -v "\[main\]"
```

**Cleanup:**
1. For each branch: check if commits are already on main (`git log main..<branch> --oneline`)
2. If unique commits exist: cherry-pick or merge the valuable ones to main
3. If already superseded: `git worktree remove <path> && git branch -D <branch>`
4. For bulk cleanup: `git worktree prune` removes stale entries

---

## Writer vs Scanner Gate Patterns

Every vidux automation is either a **writer** or a **scanner**. The distinction is structural -- it determines which gate pattern the harness uses, how the agent decides "nothing to do," and what the quick check exit looks like.

| | **Writer** | **Scanner** |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Execute tasks from a PLAN.md queue | Inspect codebase/product for issues |
| **Examples** | acme-backend, release-train, beacon-builder | localization radar, UX radar, flow radar, content radar, quality audit |
| **State source** | PLAN.md task queue (pending/in_progress/completed) | The codebase itself (files, git history, runtime output) |
| **"Nothing to do" means** | All tasks completed/blocked, no pending work | No files changed since last scan AND last N scans found no issues |
| **Gate** | Quick check gate: runs `vidux-loop.sh`, checks plan state | SCAN gate: checks git changes + last scan results |
| **Deep work** | Pop next task, execute, verify, checkpoint | Full scan of watched paths, report findings, checkpoint |

**Why this matters:** A scanner that uses a quick check gate will check if "all tasks are done" in PLAN.md and exit -- without ever looking at the codebase it is supposed to scan. Scanners do not pop tasks. They look at reality.

### Gate selection guide

```
What does the automation DO?
     |
     +--> Executes plan tasks, has vidux-loop.sh --> Quick check (With-Vidux)
     |         e.g., acme-web, beacon-release-train
     |
     +--> Executes tasks, no vidux-loop.sh      --> Quick check (Standalone)
     |         e.g., acme-asc (reads repo plan), acme-launch-loop (reads git state)
     |
     +--> Inspects codebase or product           --> SCAN
     |         e.g., acme-localization-pro, ux-radar, security-scanner
     |
     +--> Not sure                               --> Default to Quick check (Standalone)
              Writer that finds nothing just exits. Scanner on Quick check gate
              is permanently dead.
```

**The critical asymmetry:** A writer on the wrong plan file exits cleanly (no work found). A scanner on a quick check gate is permanently dead -- it checks plan state instead of codebase state, finds "nothing to do," and exits every cycle forever. This is why the default is writer, not scanner. A miscategorized writer wastes one cycle. A miscategorized scanner never runs.

---

## Quick Check Gate (Detailed Spec)

### With-Vidux variant (~850 chars)

Use when the automation uses `/vidux` and has access to `vidux-loop.sh`. Standard variant for fleet automations.

```
Quick check gate (run FIRST, before any other work):
1. Run: bash scripts/vidux-loop.sh <plan-path>
2. Read the JSON output. If ANY of these are true, checkpoint and exit immediately:
   - action is "blocked" or "auto_blocked" or "stuck" or "escalate"
   - type is "all_blocked" (all remaining tasks are blocked — escalate to human)
   - action is "complete" AND type is "done" AND queue_starved is false
   - type is "empty" (no tasks in plan)
   - auto_pause_recommended is true
   - blocker_dedup is true (same blocker reported 3+ times -- stop wasting cycles)
   - bimodal_gate is "blocked"
   Write a 1-line memory note: "[QC] <date> <reason>. No deep work."
   Do NOT read authority files, load skills, or do any other work. Exit now.
3. Read the last 3 memory notes. If the top note is a [QC] exit with the
   same reason as this run's JSON, exit with: "[QC] <date> unchanged. No deep work."
4. WORKTREE CHECK: Before creating a new worktree, check if a previous
   worktree for this lane has unmerged commits:
   git worktree list | grep "<this-lane-id>"
   If found with unmerged commits: resume it (cd into it), do not create new.
   If found but work is stale/superseded: remove it first, log in Decision Log.
5. If actionable work exists: proceed to full execution below.
Budget: steps 1-4 must complete in under 60 seconds.
```

### Standalone variant (~800 chars)

Use when the automation does not have `vidux-loop.sh` or operates outside the vidux plan model.

```
Quick check gate (run FIRST, before any other work):
1. Read the last 3 notes from this automation's memory file.
2. If the most recent note says any of: "blocked", "nothing to do", "unchanged",
   "no pending", "waiting on human", "same blocker" -- and it was written less
   than 2 hours ago -- exit immediately with a 1-line note:
   "[QC] <date> Same state as last run (<quote reason>). No deep work."
   Do NOT read authority files, load skills, or gather evidence. Exit now.
3. Read the single primary state file (plan, queue, or tracker). Count actionable
   items. If zero actionable items and no new items since the last note, exit with:
   "[QC] <date> No new work. No deep work."
3.5. If zero items in the primary file, run the five-point idle scan (Doctrine 14):
   INBOX.md -> sibling memory -> git log on owned paths -> blocked task recheck ->
   codebase TODO/FIXME scan.
   If any scan finds work: add to plan, proceed to execution.
   If all scans clean: exit with "[QC] <date> Five-point scan clean. No deep work."
4. WORKTREE CHECK: Before creating a new worktree, check if a previous
   worktree for this lane has unmerged commits. If found: resume, merge, or abandon.
5. If actionable work exists: proceed to full execution below.
Budget: steps 1-3 must complete in under 60 seconds.
```

---

## SCAN Gate (Detailed Spec)

Use for scanner and radar automations -- agents whose job is to observe, detect, and report, not to execute plan tasks. The SCAN gate checks reality (git history, file state, live surfaces) instead of plan state.

```
SCAN gate (run FIRST, before any other work):
1. Read last 3 memory notes from this automation's memory file.
   If the same "no issues found" verdict appears 3 consecutive times with no
   codebase changes between them, exit with:
   "[SCAN] <date> unchanged, no new issues. No deep work."
   Do NOT read authority files, load skills, or do any other work. Exit now.
2. Check for changes: git log --since="<timestamp of last scan>" -- <watched_paths>
3. If no changes since last scan AND last scan found no issues -> exit with:
   "[SCAN] <date> no changes to <watched_paths> since last scan. No deep work."
4. Otherwise -> proceed to full scan below.
Budget: steps 1-3 must complete in under 60 seconds.
```

**Key differences from quick check:**
- No `vidux-loop.sh` call. Scanners do not read plan state.
- The staleness check is git-based (`git log --since`), not plan-based (`next_action`).
- The "3 consecutive identical verdicts" rule prevents a radar from endlessly re-scanning unchanged code.
- `<watched_paths>` scopes the change detection to the paths the radar actually cares about (e.g., `src/` for a code scanner, `assets/locales/` for a localization radar).

**When the SCAN gate exits:** The radar found nothing new to report, and the codebase has not changed in the paths it watches.

**When the SCAN gate proceeds:** Either the codebase changed since the last scan (new commits in watched paths) or the last scan found issues that need re-verification.

---

## Fleet Health Orchestrator Pattern

When an orchestrator manages multiple automations, it must operate at fleet level, not prompt level. An orchestrator that tightens one radar prompt while 6/11 automations are idle is mid-zone work.

### When to use a coordinator

Any fleet with 5+ automations, or any fleet where 3+ automations share the same plan or target repo. Below that threshold, individual gate logic (quick check/SCAN) is sufficient.

### The 5-step fleet scan

1. **Read ALL automation memories in one pass** -- scan every sibling memory file (e.g., `~/.codex/automations/*/memory.md` or `~/.claude-automations/*/memory.md`) before taking any action. Never inspect one automation at a time.

2. **Classify each automation:**
   - SHIPPING -- actively producing commits
   - IDLE -- gate-exiting with no work
   - BLOCKED -- same blocker 2+ cycles
   - CRASHED -- auth failure, MCP disconnect
   - MID-ZONE -- 3-8 min sessions with no output

3. **Detect fleet-level patterns:**
   - N idle automations on the same plan = queue starvation (the plan has no work, not the automations)
   - Same blocker across N automations = escalation needed (human or infra fix, not retry)
   - N automations touching the same files = collision (coordinate or yield)
   - Scanner using a quick check gate = wrong gate type (scanners use SCAN)

4. **Take fleet-level action:**
   - Pause idle clusters instead of retrying them individually
   - Create escalation tasks instead of re-reporting the same blocker
   - Fix gate mismatches (scanner -> SCAN, writer -> quick check)
   - Redistribute work when queues are imbalanced across lanes

5. **Report a fleet scorecard** every cycle: N shipping / N idle / N blocked / N crashed / N mid-zone. The scorecard is the orchestrator's primary output -- not prompt edits.

6. **Detect trunk health** -- Before any fleet-level action, check if canonical checkouts in target repos are clean, up-to-date, and not diverged. If dirty/diverged, escalate as an infrastructure blocker that affects all dependent lanes. Do not report the same merge-back blocker N times per N automations -- cluster it as one root cause.

### Anti-patterns

- Editing individual prompts while the fleet is dead (mid-zone work at orchestrator level)
- Retrying the same blocker across 3+ cycles without escalating
- Spinning up new automations without checking the existing fleet (Doctrine 13)
- Treating all idle automations identically -- idle-because-queue-empty is different from idle-because-gate-misconfigured

---

## Circuit Breakers, Auto-Pause, and Bimodal Enforcement

### Bimodal gate (Doctrine 10)

> Healthy runs are bimodal: <2 min (nothing to do, checkpoint and exit) or 15+ min (real work, full e2e cycle). Mid-zone runs (3-8 min) are the disease.

Every harness must say "if you checkpoint in under 5 minutes and pending work remains, you stopped too early -- pick up the next task." Never write a harness that says "do one task and exit." Always say "keep working until the queue is empty or a hard external blocker stops you."

Quick exits are healthy when nothing is pending; mid-zone exits are stuck agents masquerading as polite ones.

Fleet data (2026-04-07): 32% of automation sessions land in the 3-8 min mid-zone. Target: <15%.

### Deep-work mid-zone kill

The quick check gate prevents mid-zone on the way in. This rule prevents it during deep work:

> If 3+ minutes pass in deep work mode with no file write and no active research query, checkpoint what you have and exit.

Do not re-read the plan, re-assess state, or "think about what to do next" -- that is quick check work happening inside a deep run. Either write a file or exit. The circuit breaker in `vidux-loop.sh` enforces this from the outside (blocks deep work after N idle cycles), but the agent should self-enforce from the inside too.

### Circuit breaker and auto_pause deadlocks

Safety mechanisms can become traps. Circuit breaker opens after N idle cycles and blocks execution. But if execution is blocked, the automation stays idle, so CB stays open. Same loop with auto_pause.

**Fix:** Ensure the Progress section has shipping signal keywords when work is actually shipped (`shipped`, `commit`, `fixed`, `merged`, `created`, `built`, `added`, `wrote`, `pushed`). If the plan's Progress section has stale entries, the safety mechanisms fire on ghosts.

### Stuck-loop mechanical enforcement

`vidux-loop.sh` enforces stuck detection without relying on LLM judgment:

1. A task appearing in 3+ Progress entries while still `[in_progress]` is stuck.
2. The script automatically flips the task from `[in_progress]` to `[blocked]` in PLAN.md.
3. A `[STUCK]` entry is appended to the Decision Log with the date and last progress note.
4. The JSON output includes `auto_blocked: true` so the harness knows enforcement fired.
5. The harness forces a surface switch on the next cycle — no human gate. The blocked task is terminal; if new evidence surfaces (observed signal, PR comment, queue re-sort), a replacement task is added with a Decision Log entry rather than reviving the blocked one.

If PLAN.md format is unexpected (missing sections, unusual markup), the enforcement degrades gracefully: stuck detection still reports `stuck: true` in JSON, but the auto-block write is skipped. No data is lost.

---

## INBOX.md Protocol (Radar -> Writer Inbox)

Scanners find issues. Writers fix issues. The inbox bridges them. Without it, radars observe problems that never reach the writer's queue, and writers check an empty PLAN.md while real issues go unaddressed.

### How it works

1. `INBOX.md` lives alongside `PLAN.md` in the project directory.

2. Scanners append findings as timestamped entries (append-only for scanners):
   ```
   - [YYYY-MM-DD] [scanner-id] Finding: <description> [Evidence: <file:line or proof path>]
   ```

3. Writers check `INBOX.md` during their READ step, **before** looking at PLAN.md tasks.

4. If an inbox entry is actionable, the writer promotes it to a `[pending]` task in PLAN.md and deletes the inbox entry.

5. If not actionable, the writer annotates it with `[SKIP: reason]` and leaves it.

6. `INBOX.md` is append-only for scanners, read-write for writers. Scanners never edit or delete entries.

7. Maximum 20 entries. If full, oldest non-skipped entries get archived to `evidence/` before new ones are appended. A full inbox means the writer is not keeping up. That is a fleet health signal, not a formatting problem.

### INBOX.md template

```markdown
# Inbox -- [Project Name]

Scanner findings awaiting writer promotion.

- [YYYY-MM-DD] [scanner-id] Finding: <description> [Evidence: <path>]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [scanner-id] Finding: <description> [Evidence: <file:line>]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] [scanner-id] Finding: <description> [SKIP: reason]
```

### Why not write directly to PLAN.md?

Scanners are read-only scouts (Doctrine: role boundary). Letting scanners mutate the task queue breaks the separation between scanning and execution. The inbox is a buffer that preserves that boundary while closing the feedback loop. (This is the radar pattern — distinct from the deprecated observer pattern, which audited a writer's own state. Scanners feed the queue; observers reported on drift.)

---

## Merge Conflict Protocol (Doctrine 16)

> When two worktrees merge back to main, both sides' work must survive. A conflict resolved by deleting one side is not a resolution -- it's data loss.

1. **Try additive merge first.** If both sides added different things (new tests, new tasks, new functions), keep both. Most conflicts are additive, not contradictory.
2. **If genuine conflict (same line, different intent):** Check commit timestamps. The more recent change is likely more correct -- it was written with knowledge of the earlier state.
3. **If tie (same timestamp, both valid):** Read both versions. Pick the one that better serves the mission. Never coin-flip.
4. **LOG every resolution.** Add a Decision Log entry: `[MERGE] <date> Conflict on <file>. Kept <branch>'s version because <reason>. Dropped: <summary>.`
5. **Never silently resolve.** A merge that touches 10 files and resolves 3 conflicts without a single log entry is suspicious. The log IS the proof that no work was lost.
6. **PLAN.md special rule:** Task count must not decrease (worktree handoff rule 5). A merge that reduces the task count without `[completed]` entries is a plan clobber, not a resolution.

### Known failure: Plan clobber via stale worktree merge

**The pattern:** A worktree branch carries a PLAN.md edit (e.g., updating a single task status). While that branch lives, origin/main advances -- 20+ new tasks are added. When the worktree branch merges to main, the merge conflict on PLAN.md resolves in favor of the branch version. Every task added since the branch diverged is silently deleted.

**Why it's dangerous:** The plan looks "complete" -- no pending tasks, no errors, a clean git status. But it is actually clobbered. Automations whose tasks vanished enter `auto_pause_recommended` because their task IDs no longer exist in the plan. They park silently for hours. No alarm fires because from the plan's perspective, there is simply nothing to do.

**Mitigation:**
- PLAN.md is append-mostly. Worktree branches should confine PLAN.md edits to their own task's status line, never rewrite the file.
- Pre-merge task count validation (see Worktree Handoff Protocol, rule 5).
- If a worktree branch is long-lived (>1 week), rebase it against origin/main before merging to pick up new tasks.
- Any merge that decreases the task count without corresponding `[completed]` entries is suspect and must be manually reviewed.

## Prompt Structure for Fleet Automations

Every automation harness prompt follows this eight-block structure, in order:

```
1. MISSION        -- One line. User-visible goal. No implementation details.
2. ENTRYPOINT     -- Use `/vidux`. Load other skills as needed ($pilot, $picasso, etc.).
3. GATE           -- Quick check or SCAN. Runs FIRST. Decides work/exit in <60 sec.
4. AUTHORITY      -- Read order for plan files. Primary state file is #1.
5. CROSS-LANE     -- Read sibling memory notes + hot-files. Dedup, yield, skip.
6. ROLE BOUNDARY  -- What this lane owns. What belongs to siblings.
7. EXECUTION      -- How to do the work. Mid-zone kill rule. Queue drain rule.
                     Worktree merge-back rule.
8. CHECKPOINT     -- Memory format. Lead line. What to leave explicit. Worktree state.
```

**Why this order matters:** The gate must run before authority reads. An agent that reads 6 authority files before discovering it has nothing to do just wasted 90 seconds. Cross-lane must come after authority but before execution, so the agent never starts work without knowing fleet state.

### Size guidance

**Target: 2000-3000 characters.**

| Range | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| < 1500 chars | Missing a block. Check: gate? cross-lane? role boundary? |
| 1500-3000 chars | Healthy. Each block is present and concise. |
| 3000-4000 chars | Audit for doctrine restatement or verbose gate logic. |
| 4000+ chars | Almost certainly restating things the skill files already provide. |

### Common prompt mistakes

1. **Gating on the wrong plan file.** The gate reads the file where actionable work items actually live.
2. **Scanner using a quick check gate.** Permanently dead automation. Use SCAN gate.
3. **Circuit breaker / auto_pause deadlocks.** Ensure Progress has shipping signal keywords.
4. **Restating doctrine in the prompt.** Agent loads doctrine via `/vidux`. Don't repeat it.
5. **Vague authority references.** Every authority file gets an absolute path and a role label.
6. **Missing mid-zone kill.** One line that saves entire cycles.
7. **Missing role boundary.** Causes drift into adjacent work and merge conflicts.
8. **Exiting on empty queue without scanning.** Doctrine 14 requires a five-point idle scan.
